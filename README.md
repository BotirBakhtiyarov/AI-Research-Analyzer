**Research Analyzer** is an open-source Django web application designed to streamline the process of uploading, analyzing, and summarizing research documents in PDF format. Leveraging AI technologies, it detects AI-generated content using a RoBERTa-based model and generates structured summaries with the DeepSeek API. This tool is ideal for researchers, students, and professionals who need to efficiently process and understand academic papers.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and logout functionality.
- **PDF Upload**: Upload research PDFs for analysis and summarization.
- **AI Content Detection**: Uses `roberta-base-openai-detector` to estimate AI-generated content probability.
- **Structured Summaries**: Generates markdown-formatted summaries streamed in real-time via the DeepSeek API.
- **Text Translation**: Translates text to Chinese using DeepSeek's language model.
- **Dashboard**: View and manage uploaded research documents.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and contribute to under the MIT License.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 5.1.7
- Git

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BotirBakhtiyarov/AI-Research-Analyzer.git
   cd AI-Research-Analyzer
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Example `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   django==5.1.7
   pdfplumber==0.11.4
   transformers==4.44.2
   openai==1.50.2
   python-dotenv==1.0.1
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your DeepSeek API key:
   ```
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Set Up the AI Detection Model:**
   Download the `roberta-base-openai-detector` model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/roberta-base-openai-detector) and place it in `core/models/roberta-base-openai-detector/`. Alternatively, the `transformers` library can fetch it automatically on first run.

6. **Apply Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Create a Superuser (Optional):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

1. **Register** or **log in** to access the dashboard.
2. **Upload** a PDF research document through the upload interface.
3. The application will:
   - Analyze the document for AI-generated content.
   - Extract basic metadata (e.g., title).
   - Generate a detailed, markdown-formatted summary.
4. View the summary on the summary page or translate text to Chinese as needed.

## Configuration

- **Debug Mode**: Set `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py` for production.
- **Allowed Hosts**: Update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py` for deployment.
- **Database**: SQLite is used by default; modify `DATABASES` in `settings.py` for alternatives like PostgreSQL.
- **Media Files**: Uploaded PDFs are stored in the `media/` directory.
