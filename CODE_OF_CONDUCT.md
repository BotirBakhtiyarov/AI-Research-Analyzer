# Research Analyzer Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The **Research Analyzer** project is dedicated to fostering an open, inclusive, and respectful community. In the interest of providing a harassment-free experience for all participants, we, as maintainers and contributors, pledge to uphold a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all individuals interacting with the project and its community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all participants to help us create a positive and collaborative experience.

## Standards of Behavior

### Expected Behavior
We encourage the following behaviors to maintain a constructive and supportive community:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
- Using respectful, professional, and inclusive language.
- Welcoming and valuing diverse perspectives and experiences.
- Offering and accepting constructive feedback graciously.
- Prioritizing the collective good of the community over individual interests.

### Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered unacceptable and will not be tolerated:
- Harassment, including offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, or other personal characteristics.
- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances of any kind.
- Trolling, derogatory remarks, or personal attacks.
- Public or private intimidation, stalking, or harassment.
- Publishing private information (e.g., email addresses, physical addresses) without explicit consent.
- Any conduct that a reasonable person would deem inappropriate in a professional or collaborative setting.

## Scope of Application

This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related spaces, including but not limited to:
- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, comments, code).
- Communication channels (e.g., email, forums, or future platforms adopted by the project).
- Public spaces where an individual represents **Research Analyzer**, such as conferences, meetups, or online discussions.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are tasked with upholding these standards. They are responsible for:
- Clarifying and communicating acceptable behavior.
- Investigating reports of violations in a fair and timely manner.
- Taking appropriate corrective action, which may include removing content, issuing warnings, or banning individuals from participation.

Maintainers reserve the right to address contributions (e.g., comments, code, or other submissions) that violate this Code of Conduct by editing, rejecting, or removing them as necessary.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. Until a dedicated reporting channel is established, you may:
- Open a private issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/BotirBakhtiyarov/AI-Research-Analyzer/issues) with the title "Confidential: Code of Conduct Violation" and mark it as private (if your repository supports this feature).
- Contact the maintainers directly via GitHub by messaging the project owner.

Reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality regarding the reporterâ€™s identity. Include the following in your report:
- Your contact information (optional, for follow-up).
- A description of the incident, including when and where it occurred.
- Any additional context or evidence (e.g., screenshots).

Once a formal reporting email or channel is available, this section will be updated accordingly.

## Enforcement Process

Upon receiving a report:
1. Maintainers will review the incident and gather relevant information.
2. A determination will be made regarding whether a violation occurred and its severity.
3. Appropriate action will be taken, ranging from a private warning to a permanent ban from the project, depending on the circumstances.

All enforcement decisions will be made in good faith, with the goal of preserving a safe and productive community.

## Attribution and Inspiration

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), with modifications to suit the needs of **Research Analyzer**. We are grateful to the open-source community for providing frameworks that promote collaboration and respect.
